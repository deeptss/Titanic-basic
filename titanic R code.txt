In this exercise, you'll work with one of the most popular starter data sets in data science, the Titanic data set. This is a data set that records various attributes of passengers on the Titanic, including who survived and who didn’t.
Getting started

#######################
Exercise
Using R, you’ll be handling missing values in this data set, and creating a new data set. Specifically, these are the tasks you need to do:

#######################
0: Load the data in RStudio
Save the data set as a CSV file called titanic_original.csv and load it in RStudio into a data frame.
*************************
titanic <- read.csv("~/titanic.csv")
titanic1 <- titanic 
**************************
#######################

1: Port of embarkation
The embarked column has some missing values, which are known to correspond to passengers who actually embarked at Southampton. Find the missing values and replace them with S. (Caution: Sometimes a missing value might be read into R as a blank or empty string.)

***************************
length(titanic1$embarked[titanic1$embarked == "S"]) ### Total number of "S" entries 914 before fixing missing values ###

length(titanic1$embarked[titanic1$embarked == ""]) #### Returned 3 as there are 3 Missing values for emabarked###

titanic1$embarked[titanic1$embarked == ""] <- "S" ### fixed missing values ###

length(titanic1$embarked[titanic1$embarked == "S"]) ### After fixing missing values result is 917

****************************
########################

2: Age
You’ll notice that a lot of the values in the Age column are missing. While there are many ways to fill these missing values, using the mean or median of the rest of the values is quite common in such cases.
Calculate the mean of the Age column and use that value to populate the missing values
Think about other ways you could have populated the missing values in the age column. Why would you pick any of those over the mean (or not)?

***********************************
length(titanic1$age[is.na(titanic1$age)] #### Number of NA values in age column = 264

titanic1$age[is.na(titanic1$age)] <- 0 #### Converting them to 0 to calculate Mean value

mean(titanic1$age) #### Mean of age values 23.8592

length(titanic1$age[titanic1$age == 0]) #### 264 total number of null attributes which needs to be updated to mean value

titanic1$age[titanic1$age == 0] <- 23.8592 #### Updated the null age attributes to Average age 

************************************



3: Lifeboat
You’re interested in looking at the distribution of passengers in different lifeboats, but as we know, many passengers did not make it to a boat :-( This means that there are a lot of missing values in the boat column. Fill these empty slots with a dummy value e.g. the string 'None' or 'NA'
4: Cabin
You notice that many passengers don’t have a cabin number associated with them.
Does it make sense to fill missing cabin numbers with a value?
What does a missing value here mean?
You have a hunch that the fact that the cabin number is missing might be a useful indicator of survival. Create a new column has_cabin_number which has 1 if there is a cabin number, and 0 otherwise.
6: Submit the project on Github
Include your code, the original data as a CSV file titanic_original.csv, and the cleaned up data as a CSV file called titanic_clean.csv.
